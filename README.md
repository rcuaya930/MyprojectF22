Determining the matches of participants in the program out of 100 graduates from 10 countries to participate in DWB program. The programs show the probability of being matched based on Language and Specialization in medicine. 

This program will use a list of vectors that have Languague fluency, specialization in medicine, and country. Then it will produce participants base on their language fluency, specialization and the computed matching probability in percent.

Finally, it will calculate the matching probability for each participant by counting the number of possible matches and multiplying it by 14 The output of the program will be the participant,their language fluency, specialization and the computed matching probability in percent.

Instructions: Run the program and it will provide the probability based on the Language, Country, and Specialization and using that it will show how likely others are to also be in that specialization
